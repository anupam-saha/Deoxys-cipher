We have implemented the Deoxys cipher which includes the concept of well known AES algorithm. The encryption part takes as input a variable length plaintext, a variable length associated data, a fixed length public message number and a k bit key. After encryption, it outputs the corresponding ciphertext and a tag (unique for the particular nonce and key).
In short, Deoxys is an authenticated encryption scheme that provides full 128bit security for both privacy and authenticity.
